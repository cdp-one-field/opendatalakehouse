In this lab, we will continue the steps from 01\_ingest. We will use the data imported to the landing zone on CDP Object Store to create a dynamic schema, enrich the data and create tables for further analysis, visualization and data science.

This lab demonstrates ETL/ELT workflow to enrich the data to allow users to perform analysis, visualize and create machine learning models.

1. On your CDP One console, click on ```INGEST``` filter
2. Now, right click on the processor group ```Step 2\) Data Engineering & ETL/ELT Configuration``` again
